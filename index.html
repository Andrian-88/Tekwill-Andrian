            <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
            <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and <br> describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
            </p>
            <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video,<br> etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
            </p>
            <span>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
            </span>
            <ol>
                <li>The opening tag</li>
                <li>The closing tag</li>
                <li>The actual element</li>
            </ol>

        </div>
        <h4>Why should you learn HTML?</h4>
        <div>
            <span>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
                <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
                <li>To build web applications</li>
                <li>To impress friends</li>
                <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
